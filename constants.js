export const MISSION_BRIEFING = `
Welcome, pilot. We've been waiting for this moment.

Tonight, it's happening — this is not a drill. On the night of June 13th, 2025, we initiate *Operation Am Kelavi*: Israel's preemptive strike deep into Iranian territory. After months of escalation and undeniable threats to our civilians, we no longer have the luxury of waiting.

You’ll be flying one of our stealth F-35s into hostile airspace, under cover of darkness, to intercept key threats: ballistic missile sites, armed UAV swarms, and hostile enemy aircraft. Your mission is clear — neutralize the threat before it reaches Israeli soil. The defense of our people depends on your precision, your courage, and your resolve.

Godspeed, warrior. We'll see you back at base.

export const ABOUT = `
Following the brutal massacre of October 7th, 2023, Israel found itself thrust into a new and uncertain era. What began with a devastating terror attack on our southern communities quickly escalated into a broader regional threat — with Iran openly backing and arming hostile forces across multiple fronts.

As tensions intensified, and with Israeli civilians living under constant threat of rockets, drones, and long-range missiles, the necessity for a decisive and preemptive operation became clear.

This game is dedicated to the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces — to the pilots in the skies, the soldiers on the ground, the intelligence officers in the shadows, and the families who stand behind them.

Your courage, sacrifice, and unwavering spirit are the heartbeat of our nation's defense.

/* Mission 1 Briefing */
export const MISSION_1_BRIEFING = `
Welcome, pilot. This is the beginning.

At 02:00 on the night of June 13th, 2025, you'll launch the first wave of *Operation Am Kelavi*. This is the opening strike — designed to clear a safe corridor through hostile skies and pave the way for the full-scale air campaign.

Your primary objective is to secure the airspace. Expect resistance: enemy F-4 Phantom jets still patrol key zones, surface-to-air missile batteries remain active, and radar coverage is tight. You must neutralize these aerial threats swiftly and precisely to ensure safe passage for the rest of the IAF.

Failure is not an option — the success of the operation depends on your courage and execution.

Take off, clear the skies, and bring us one step closer to victory.

/* Mission 2 Briefing */
export const MISSION_2_BRIEFING = `
Mission two is surgical.

Intelligence has confirmed the location of several enemy nuclear scientists — key figures in their atomic weapons program. Tonight, under cover of darkness, you will carry out a precision strike to eliminate this threat before it becomes irreversible.

You are to strike only the designated facilities. Civilian structures are off-limits — we do not target innocents. The enemy may attempt to shield these targets behind populated areas, but we trust your judgment and skill to hit only what must be hit.

This mission isn't just about defense — it's about shaping the future. Execute with discipline. Return with honor.

Your precision is our shield.
`;

/* Mission 3 Briefing */
export const MISSION_3_BRIEFING = `
Time is critical, pilot.

We have confirmed multiple ballistic missile launches from deep within Iranian territory — their targets: civilian population centers across Israel. This is not a simulation. The countdown has already begun.

Your mission is a timed strike. You are to locate and destroy the mobile rocket launchers before the missiles reach our skies. Each second counts. Every target you eliminate could mean thousands of lives saved.

Speed. Precision. Resolve. You are our first and last line of defense tonight.

Go now. The clock is ticking.
`;

/* Mission 4 Briefing */
export const MISSION_4_BRIEFING = `
This is it, pilot. The turning point.

Tonight, you won’t be flying the agile F-35 — you’re stepping into the cockpit of the B-2 Spirit. Your objective: *Fordow*. Deep beneath the mountains, the enemy's nuclear facility is nearing full operational capability. We cannot allow that to happen.

The skies won’t be clear. Expect a dense swarm of F-4 Phantoms and surface-to-surface missile fire. But your payload is decisive — and your mission is critical.

Penetrate the defenses. Deliver the strike. Eliminate the threat once and for all.

The region — and the world — are counting on you.
`;

/* Mission 5 Briefing */
export const MISSION_5_BRIEFING = `
This is the endgame, pilot.

You’ve flown through fire, darkness, and chaos — and now, you face the final threat. Intelligence confirms the Supreme Leader is entrenched within a fortified command center, directing the last wave of strikes. This is your target.

Tonight, you carry more than weapons. You carry the hope of a nation under threat — and the silent prayers of millions under oppression. This mission is not only about protecting Israel — it's about ending tyranny and giving the people of Iran a chance to breathe free.

Fly with precision. Strike with resolve. Finish this.

History is watching.
`;

/* Mission Success Briefing */
export const MISSION_SUCCESS_BRIEFING = `
You did it, pilot.

Against all odds — through radar fields, relentless skies, and hostile fire — you carried out your missions with unwavering courage and unmatched precision.

Tonight, the threat has been neutralized. The missiles are silenced. The skies are ours. And deep beneath the soil of our adversary, the engines of destruction have been dismantled.

The people of Israel — every family, every child who sleeps safely tonight — owe you a debt that cannot be measured. You did not fly for glory. You flew for peace. For survival. For the future.

Your name may remain in the shadows... but your actions will echo for generations.

Welcome home, warrior.
