export const MISSION_BRIEFING = `
Welcome, pilot. We've been waiting for this moment.

Tonight, it's happening — this is not a drill. On the night of June 13th, 2025, we initiate *Operation Am Kelavi*: Israel's preemptive strike deep into Iranian territory. After months of escalation and undeniable threats to our civilians, we no longer have the luxury of waiting.

You’ll be flying one of our stealth F-35s into hostile airspace, under cover of darkness, to intercept key threats: ballistic missile sites, armed UAV swarms, and hostile enemy aircraft. Your mission is clear — neutralize the threat before it reaches Israeli soil. The defense of our people depends on your precision, your courage, and your resolve.

Godspeed, warrior. We'll see you back at base.

export const ABOUT = `
Following the brutal massacre of October 7th, 2023, Israel found itself thrust into a new and uncertain era. What began with a devastating terror attack on our southern communities quickly escalated into a broader regional threat — with Iran openly backing and arming hostile forces across multiple fronts.

As tensions intensified, and with Israeli civilians living under constant threat of rockets, drones, and long-range missiles, the necessity for a decisive and preemptive operation became clear. Thus, Operation Am Kelavi was born — a fictional depiction of what such a mission could look like, through the eyes of a lone IAF F-35 pilot.

This game is dedicated to the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces — to the pilots in the skies, the soldiers on the ground, the intelligence officers in the shadows, and the families who stand behind them.

Your courage, sacrifice, and unwavering spirit are the heartbeat of our nation's defense.
